# Build Your Onchain Agent
I've been using AI to assist with on-chain trading, also open source some project ideas to explore the potential of on-chain agents, from monitoring to trade analysis. My goal is to release a new project every 1-2 weeks.

## Contents
### **Project 1: Massive Wallet Signal Monitoring System**

Overview: Tracks 100K Solana wallets + AI-powered tweet summaries using Helius Webhooks, Supabase, Vercel, and DeepSeek.

### Why Open Source?
Perhaps it's the desire to share the joy and solitude of solving a problem that few have discussed, perhaps it's the desire to contribute something meaningful to world beyond providing liquidity. Or it’s the desire to build more connections with on chain AI developers and exploring new possibilities together.

I did consider whether sharing this would make the already competitive on-chain space even more intense. But wallet monitoring is essential for any serious trader, it’s just been limited until now. I’ve heard of people running multiple GMGN accounts in incognito windows just to track more wallets. This project simply turns a 1 SOL paid tool into a free alternative, pushing the ecosystem toward better, more valuable paid tools.

Wallet monitoring is just the first step, taking ownership of on-chain data. This series will explore agentic workflows for deeper on-chain trading automation.
